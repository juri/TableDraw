# TableDraw

TableDraw is a Swift library for drawing tables in the terminal.
It uses a result builder based syntax.

You can specify styles (alignment, padding etc) for table columns
and then just provide the table data, and TableDraw will calculate
column widths and row heights and draw any borders you have configured.

For examples of usage, see the `Tests` folder.
